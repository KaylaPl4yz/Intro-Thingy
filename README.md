## DNI // IWC

Disrespecting people with triggers? Immediate dni.


As for Interacting with caution, Transformers Fans and Dandy's world fans please Iwc . Trolls please iwc. 

> DNI SPECIFIC USERS :: MOOTS W/ THEM IWEC

- Alfries
- 60s Megatron
- Poof76
- Average Vaeb
- youcantstopthef1re (Wind Archer?? + their fire spirit cookie friend too)

Reasons (?? editing this) :: In order of the people mentioned!

- Past issues, Has harrassed me and multiple other people in the Transformers area on multiple occasions . Has claimed 'styles' that arent even his himself . He's on the other Transformers people Dni list.

- Same with Alfries . Again, Harassed my friends in public . 

- Now this, please understand . I am not hating, but im just upset . They have been the reason my old VPI lore was scrapped (Additional bosses, too many sidelines, and overall someâ€” if not, most of their lore set for their own npc character in VPI contradicted to the previous lore of VPI as a whole) . Me and a friend (i wonr mention) have felt odd in a way interacting with them .

- For these three (Average and the cookies). The cookies, They have harassed my friends over something as simple as having 'Gooner' in their pony names in an oc maker when they only put them there as a joke . We have told them to stop spam rolling and was even warned by host but ended up hiding them . For Average, In an oc maker, They kept inviting the cookies back despite alresdy being kicked by host . Not to mention the fact that they have been rude to other people online .

Please I beg of you to just be respectful and kind . Im not a rude person, I promise . I only bite if boundaries have been crossed too much . Remember that this is an online space, not your average discord bullying group chat .
